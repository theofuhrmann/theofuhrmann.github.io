            <h3> Cybervulnerability Exploitability Classifier </h3>
            <p>
              For my final thesis for my Computer Science degree I trained
              various machine learning models with gathered CVE data to predict
              the potential exploitability of cybervulnerabilities.

            <h3> Voice-Sex Recognition Classifier </h3>
            <p>
              Found patterns given various voice features to recognize the sex
              of the speaker using neural networks and other machine learning
              models.

            <h3> Interactive Delaunay triangulation </h3>
            <p>
              Implemented the Delaunay triangulation with HTML, CSS and
              JavaScript using a doubly connected edge list (DCEL). This
              specific triangulation is used for modelling terrains with a nice
              set of triangles to use as polygons in the models by avoiding
              narrow triangles.

            <h3> AI Player for Moria </h3>
            <p>
              Artificial Intelligence for a player in the Moria competition, a
              contest involving 240+ computer science students at the Barcelona
              UPC enrolled in the Data Structure & Algorithms class in 2019.
              <br />
              <br />
              The algorithm built with C++ controls 20 dwarfs and 5 wizards that
              have to loot the treasures and attack the 3 other players that are
              playing in the same board and other engine-powered enemies to
              maximise the score and win.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is a very fun and interesting game where I had to take into
              account many variables to engineer a strategy to survive for 235
              rounds and this AI made it to the finals!
